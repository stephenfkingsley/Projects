Code Projects I have done

This is one of the projects I am doing in my Build Front-End Applications from Scratch  Codecademy Pro Course I am taking.  
I have the unique opportunity to interact with a network of aspiring programmers!  
I also get to interact and get feedback from Professional Programmers to help jumpstart my growth.

This is only the beginning to a career that I have found an inspiring passion for!
